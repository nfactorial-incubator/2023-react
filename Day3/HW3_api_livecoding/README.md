# 🚀 API homework

Welcome to your third assignment! This week, we'll be rewriting your first homework's**TodoList app** using [Todoist service](https://todoist.com/ru "Todoist service"). 
Your app doesn't have to look exactly like our example, so let your creative juices flow! 💫

Firstly, install dependencies using `npm install`
Secondly, check [Todoist service's API documentation](https://todoist.com/ru "Todoist service's API documentation") to generate API key
Thirdly, create `.env` file and using example from `.env.example` set your `TODOIST_API_KEY`
Then, realise `TaskService` class with CRUD operations using `axios`

Your app should have these core features:

1. **Adding Todo Items (POST request)**: Users should be able to add new tasks to their list using TodoistAPI.
2. **Removing Todo Items (DELETE request)**: Users should be able to remove tasks when they are no longer necessary using TodoitAPI.
3. **Checking Off Todos**: Users should be able to mark tasks as completed using TodoistAPI

For an extra challenge, also try creating `projects` (an array of tasks). P.S: you should realise `ProjectService` as well, create new components. Show all your knowledges using `axios`🚀
